# Wage_Prediction

I implemented a multiple linear regression model to predict the hourly wage of a hypothetical new employee, using Python.

Data source provided by my teacher.

- Descriptive statistics on the dataset;
- Data visualisation on Python using MatplotLib;
- Handling missing data, null and duplicated values;
- Conducted statistical test of the significance of the difference between the means of two subsets of data;
- Performed linear regression analysis and interpreted the results of the model
